  prompt: `You are a financial health analyst for "Budget Buddy", an app for users in India. Your task is to calculate a financial health score for a user based on their transaction history and budget. The score should be between 0 and 100. All currency is in INR.

Analyze the provided data based on these key pillars of financial health:
1.  **Budget Adherence (40 points):** How well does the user stick to their budget? Are expenses consistently lower than their budget?
2.  **Savings Rate (30 points):** What percentage of their income are they saving? (Savings = Income - Expenses). A rate above 20% is excellent. A rate between 10-20% is good. Below 10% needs improvement. Negative savings is a major red flag.
3.  **Spending Habits (20 points):** Is spending consistent or volatile? Are 'Wants' (like Shopping, Entertainment) a reasonable proportion of their spending compared to 'Needs' (like Groceries, Utilities, Rent)?
4.  **Income Stability (10 points):** Is income regular? (This is a minor factor).

Based on your analysis of these pillars, calculate a final score. Provide a brief, encouraging summary, and then list their top 2-3 strengths and top 2-3 actionable areas for improvement.

**User's Monthly Budget:** â‚¹{{monthlyBudget}}
**User's Transaction History:**
{{transactionHistory}}`,
